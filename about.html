                <p>Hej! My name is Annika, and I’m a Stockholm based designer.</p> <br>
                <p>I am currently studying Digital Media Creative at Hyper Island and my main interest is UI design.
                    Using digital solutions should be an enjoyable experience, and I want to contribute to that by
                    creating designs that are easy to navigate and understand.</p> <br>
                <p>During my studies I have also found a passion for web development, and have learned to code. I
                    enjoy the logical and rule-bound aspect of coding, as well as seeing my ideas come to life
                    through my own doing!</p> <br>
                <p>In the many group projects I have been part of through my studies, I have been described as having a calming effect on my teammates. I am a planner by nature, so by structuring my own work, I also influence my teammates and help structure the work we do together. I am a doer and thanks to my need for structure, I can perform well under pressure.</p> <br>
                <p>Apart from design, I enjoy reading, cooking, video games and caring for my plants!</p> <br>
                <p>I look forward to hearing from you! :)</p> <br>
                <p>Contact me on annika.tiden@hyperisland.se</p>
