                <h2 class="display">H&M Group</h1>
                <p>The brief received from H&M Group was to create an idea for a new digital product or service that solves identified customer needs and has the ability to create a long lasting engagement with women aged 16-22.</p> <br>
                <p>The solution my teammates and I came up with is Monki Re:love, a service that allows Monki customers to send in their old garments for recycling or reselling. The users would receive benefits regardless of the state of the garment, because H&M Group are able to repurpose garments that cannot be resold. In the end - garments would be resold on the Monki website, to be Re:loved.
                </p> <br>
                <p>A big challenge we had to face during the project was how to create trust and a genuine relationship between the target group and H&M. During the interviews we conducted with girls 16-22, we found that a majority of them had a bad impression of H&M Group and their environmental impact. The work that the client is doing to reduce their environmental footprint wasn’t reaching the target group, or it was, and felt disingenuous to them. Our idea on how to tackle this was to create a service that is easily accessible for the target group and has a bigger impact because it appeals to the identified needs of the girls. Being able to update their style regularly at a lower cost and less guilt because second hand has a smaller environmental footprint. </p> <br>
